career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a scientist studying solar physics and space weather. I have been actively applying deep learning to my research area. My goal is to improve our understanding of the Sun and enhance our ability to predict the effects of solar activity on Earth. To achieve this, I am trying to develop deep learning models to process, reprocess, and improve the quality of solar and space weather data.
