    summary: |
      This page is under construction!!!!

      I am a scientist who studying solar and space weather physics and developing deep learning model to models to analyze and interpret solar and space weather data. 
      With my experiences in solar physics and deep learning, I aim to improve our understanding of the sun and enhance our ability to predict the effects of solar activity on Earth. 
      To achieve this, I am trying to develop deep learning models to process, reprocess, and improve the quality of solar and space weather data.

      In short, make our datasets more valuable!
